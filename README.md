Talk given 6/25/2019

> Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is an AWS service
offering a managed Kubernetes control plane for customers to orchestrate their
containerized applications on Amazon EC2. In this chalk talk, Micah Hausler, AWS
system development engineer, explains how customers can ensure the integrity and
auditability of their applications on Amazon EKS. He demonstrates the
exploitation of a misconfigured web application container, and he conducts a
forensic analysis of what happened in the system.
